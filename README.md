Description
A simple NodeJS program that generates a professional README markdown file based on user input. Use this to create a full README or a template to get you started. Even this README was made with the program!

This program utilizes the Inquirer package to prompt the user through the command line. Made during the University of Utah's coding bootcamp, this was one of my first command line applications.

Usage
After using the node index.js command, running the app is simple! You will be given a number of prompts to answer. Once you answer all of the questions the README.md file will be created in the /dist folder of the project. This process can be seen in the GIF below. From there simply copy the README from the /dist directory and paste it in your new project.
